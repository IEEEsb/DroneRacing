## Pagoda FPV 5.8GHz antenna
Pagoda V2 Antenna by Maarten Baert panelized in a value pack including 3 copies of Pagoda PCB's with breakaway alignment struts, a modified assembly jig, a ruler for measuring the coax length, a coax stripping depth gauge for RP-SMA center contacts and a template for cutting
styrofoam discs to fill the pagoda, all of that on a single 10x10cm board. 

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL, DO NOT USE THESE FILES FOR ORDERING UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
An experimental batch has been sent to elecrow to see if it can be manufactured at all and if the assembly jig works. Cost per PCB is $1.70 at elecrow using their 10x green PCB 10x10cm special offer. That's $0.57 per pagoda PCB pack.

EDIT:
Boards arrived, the concept DOES work, PCB milling is spot on and, as the assembly jig is heat ressistant and self aligned, pagodas can be mass-soldered in an oven with them. However, its VERY hard to separate the boards as intended in the design without prematurely breaking the aligmnent-support tabs. A new version to solve this issue is on its way. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THE CURRENT FILES!
