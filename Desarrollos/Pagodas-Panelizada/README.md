## Pagoda FPV 5.8GHz antenna
Pagoda Antenna by Maarten Baert panelized to fit the 3 PCB's on a single gerber
that can be manufactured for cheap as a single board (no extra costs).
Just cut the tabs with cutting pliers and sand the remainings to separate the
PCB's.

They fit on a 50x50 mm board but the resuling panel isn't very stable and I didn't want
to risk it being rejected. It's a 70x50mm board.

Boards have manufactured at elecrow and work. Check if your manufacturer supports
the internal routing feature of this board.
